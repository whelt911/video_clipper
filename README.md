video_clipper

This script utilizes moviepy and ImageMagick to clip videos while adding an intro screen and text overlay.

The script was writtin to support a project by RI DEM and The Nature Conservancy.  The project samples benthic substrate of the
Providence River through the use of video transects.  The script also includes a random_clipper function that will create a 
desired number of 10s clips of a video for random subsampling.

Future work for this script will include adding an overlay that references the geographic coordinates of the video and abiotic data
by syncing timestamps.
